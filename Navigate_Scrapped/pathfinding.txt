
This will be my own pathfinding algorithm

This will be based on the Nextbot AI and the PVZ Ops pathfinding. This will make the path randomized and make sure the bot gets to its goal,
it DOESN'T have to be the shortest path.

To optimize this pathfinding algorithm, there will be bot pathfind groups. In this group, each bot will have the same destination.
There will only one bot actually pathfinding its way to its goal, the others follow the pathfinder's path.
